    <h3>9. Disclosures of Data</h3>
    <p>We may share Data with the parties set out in Article (6) in relation to the specified purposes for which we will
        use
        the Data above.</p>
    <p>We may share Data with third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or
        our
        assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our
        business,
        then the new owners may use Data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do
        not allow
        our third-party service providers to use Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process Data for
        specified
        purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
    <h3>10. Data security</h3>
    <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed
        in an
        unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to Data to those employees, contractors,
        third
        party service providers and other parties who have a valid need to know. They will only process Data in
        accordance with
        our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Data breach and will notify you and any applicable
        regulator
        of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
    <h3>11. Data retention</h3>
    <p>How long will we use Data?</p>
    <p>We will only retain Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
        including for
        the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory or reporting requirements. We may retain Data for a longer
        period in
        the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our
        relationship
        with you.</p>
    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the
        Data, the
        potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of Data, the purposes for which we process Data and
        whether
        we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, or other requirements.
    </p>
    <p>When it is no longer necessary to retain Data, we will delete it.</p>
    <h3>12. What we may need from you</h3>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
        access
        Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Data is not disclosed
        to any
        person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information to improve our
        Services.</p>
    <h3>13. How do we deal with the “right to be forgotten”?</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the erasure of Data that we hold about you in certain circumstances, for example if
        it
        were not acquired for, or has ceased to be necessary for, a lawful purpose. This is known as the right to be
        forgotten.
        Where you request that we erase your Data, we will usually only do so where the Data has ceased to be publicly
        available
        or where we no longer use it.</p>
    <h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
    <p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to
        give you

        Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are
        otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our
        legitimate
        interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>

        that
        we are subject to.</p>

    <h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <p>Access to Data on our Website. This enables you to receive a copy of Data we hold about you and to check that we
        are
        lawfully processing it.</p>
    <p>Request correction of the Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate Data
        we
        hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new Data you provide to us.</p>
    <p>Request erasure of personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Data where there is no good
        reason for
        us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove Data where you have
        successfully
        exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
        unlawfully or
        where we are required to erase Data to comply with local law.</p>
    Object to processing of Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
    something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
    impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing Data for
    direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process
    your
    information which override your rights and freedoms.
    <p>Request restriction of processing of Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Data in the
        following
        scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>If you want us to establish the Data's accuracy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Where our use of the Data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Where you need us to hold the Data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
            or defend
            legal claims.</li>
        <li>You have objected to our use of Data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds
            to use it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process Data. However, this will not affect the
        lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may
        not be
        able to provide the Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your
        consent.</p>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access Data (or to exercise any of the other rights).</p>

        out
        above, please contact us on our contact details mentioned in Section 3.3 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
